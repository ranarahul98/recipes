# Arroz con Pollo

## Ingredients

### Blend:
- 1 large tomato (or 1 can fire-roasted diced tomatoes for more depth)
- 1 cube chicken bouillon
- 3 cloves garlic

### Other Ingredients:
- 2 cloves garlic, minced (for deeper flavor)
- Bone-in drumsticks (dark meat, or a mix of drumsticks & thighs for more tenderness)
- 1 cup chicken broth (use homemade or low-sodium for better control over seasoning)
- ½ onion, finely chopped (mom recommends ¼, but extra onion enhances flavor)
- 1 tsp cumin (or to taste)
- 1 cup long-grain white rice (rinse well to remove excess starch for a fluffier texture)
- 1 can fire-roasted diced tomatoes (or blended tomato mixture)
- ½ tsp smoked paprika (adds a subtle smokiness)
- ½ tsp dried oregano (enhances aroma and depth)
- Salt & pepper (to taste)
- Olive oil
- 1 cup water (from boiled chicken)
- Chopped fresh cilantro (optional, for garnish)

## Instructions

1. **Boil the Chicken**  
   - In a pot, boil the drumsticks (or mix of drumsticks & thighs) with cumin, salt, pepper, and a bay leaf for extra flavor.
   - Reserve 1 cup of the boiling water for later use.

2. **Prepare the Rice**  
   - Wash the rice thoroughly until the water runs clear.
   - In a pan over medium heat, sauté the minced garlic and onion in a small amount of olive oil for 2-3 minutes until fragrant.
   - Add the rinsed rice and toast it until slightly golden and aromatic.

3. **Combine Ingredients**  
   - Once the rice is toasted, stir in the blended tomato mixture or fire-roasted diced tomatoes.
   - Add smoked paprika and dried oregano for a deeper, more aromatic flavor.
   - Pour in 1 cup of chicken broth and 1 cup of the reserved boiled chicken water.
   - Nestle the boiled chicken into the pan, allowing the flavors to infuse.

4. **Cooking the Rice**  
   - Cover and cook on medium heat for **20-30 minutes**, or until the rice is tender.
   - Do not stir unless adding more water.

5. **Final Touches**  
   - Let the rice rest, covered, for 5 minutes off the heat.
   - Fluff with a fork and garnish with fresh cilantro for a burst of freshness.
